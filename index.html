				<h2>COVID Protocol</h2>
                <p>At the reunion we have are going to have plenty of children too young to get vaccinated and beloved elders who are a more at risk population. We ask that you help make sure every one can get to Fisher Reunion 2025 by taking the following precautions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>During this weekend we will be doing as many activities outside as possible.</li>
                    <li>Please try to limit unnecessary exposure in the week leading up to the reunion</li>
                    <li>We strongly encourage testing before attending, doubly so if you are feeling any symptoms. If you test positive, we ask you sit this one out.</li>
                    <li>If you have home tests, please bring some along</li>
                    <li>Please bring several masks along. They are not required, but it is good to have them on hand</li> 
                    <li>If you start to have symptoms, please take one of the home tests. We will have a separate quarantine space for you if you are positive</li>
                </ul>
                <p>

Bring any snacks if you would like! We are putting a lot of thought into making our snack table more covid conscious, so take that into consideration when choosing what snacks to bring.
            </div>
            <div>
Have a kid you need to entertain? Be on the lookout for a kids table set up with activities for the young (or young at heart!) to do.
            </div>
            <div>
Bring some games to play with others!
